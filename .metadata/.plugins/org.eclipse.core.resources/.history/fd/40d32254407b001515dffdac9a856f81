1. Learning Spring from https://javabrains.io/courses/spring_core/lessons/Writing-Code-Using-the-Bean-Factory
2. Learned Dependency Injection
3. Learned How Spring works on FactoryPattern 
and Spring implements this using its BeanFactory 
that is a called and reads configurations from XML file(mostly called bean.xml/or any name defined in main class)
BeanFactory : org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory

4. Use of ApplicationContext=(BeanFactor + Additional Functionality), it can do all that BeanContext can do.
ApplicationContext users - ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("filename.xml") to instantiate. 
filename.xml should be in the class path. 
5. Setters injection :
	Instantiating variables of object : Property tag in XML uses Setters to inject the values to the object
	<property name="type" value="Equilateral" />
6.Constructor Injection :
	<constructor-arg value="20" />
	OR
	<constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="20" />
	OR
	<constructor-arg index="0" value="20" />
	type is not mandatory unless you have ambiguous constructors 
7.For objects: eg with Point.java
	<property name="pointA" ref="zeroPoint" />
	
8.Inner Bean - Beans inside bean (it could not be used by other objects)   
9.Alias - We can give aliases
10. autoWire 
	We can autoWire = byName, byType(should have only one Bean per Type), byConstructor (it works similar to byType, just that it does not use setters, but uses constructors)

1. Spring Bean Scopes :
Reference : https://javabrains.io/courses/spring_core/lessons/Understanding-Bean-Scopes
	ApplicationContext creates all the beans in XML once it is initialized.
	This is configurable. But above is default.
	Here Comes Scopes in picture: 
	Basic Scopes :
	a. Singleton - (Default) Only once per Spring container. It looks all the beans and initialize 1 bean only once. No matter how many calls have been done to it. 
	b. Prototype - new object every time there is a request or reference. It does not get created with context initialization itself
	Other Scopes :
	c. Web-aware Context Bean Scopes - 
		Request - new bean per servlet request
		Session - new bean per servlet session
		Global Sessions - New bean per global HTTP session (portlet context)
